Task – 2: ATM Interface Project
Project Overview:
In this project, we aim to develop an ATM interface program using Java. This project will 
simulate the functionalities of a real ATM machine, providing users with a secure and intuitive 
way to perform banking operations.

1. Project Details:
• The ATM interface program will allow users to perform various banking operations 
such as checking balance, withdrawing money, and depositing money.

• Users will be prompted to enter their user ID and PIN upon startup for authentication.

• Upon successful authentication, users will gain access to the ATM functionalities.

• Error handling mechanisms will be implemented to handle invalid user input, 
insufficient funds, etc.

• The program will provide informative messages to guide users through the ATM 
interface.

3. To create a ATM Interface in Java, you can follow these steps:
• Create a Java Project: Begin by creating a new Java project in your preferred IDE or 
code editor.

• Define ATM Functionalities: Determine the functionalities to include in the ATM 
interface program, such as checking balance, withdrawing money, and depositing 
money.

• Create User Class: Define a user class to represent each user of the ATM. Include 
attributes like userID, userPIN, and accountBalance.

• Create ATM Class: Define an ATM class that encapsulates ATM functionalities. Include 
methods for performing operations like checking balance, withdrawing money, and 
depositing money.

• Implement User Authentication: Prompt users to enter their user ID and PIN upon 
startup. Validate the entered credentials against stored user data.

• Handle Input/Output: Use Java's input/output functionalities to interact with users. 
Display appropriate messages and prompts to guide users through the ATM interface.

• Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to deal with invalid user input, 
insufficient funds, etc. Provide informative error messages to assist users in correcting 
their mistakes.

• Testing and Debugging: Thoroughly test the program with different scenarios to 
ensure functionality and reliability. Debug any issues encountered during testing and 
make necessary adjustments to the code.

• Documentation: Document the code using comments to explain the purpose of each 
class, method, and significant block of code. Include a README file with instructions 
on running the program and other relevant information.
